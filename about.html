        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, I’m <span class="purple">Vanshika Rana</span>, a 3rd year B.Tech Computer Science student at Himachal Pradesh Technical University with a curious mind and a passion for exploring knowledge beyond boundaries.</p>

        <p>I believe in learning deeply, thinking differently, and building solutions that not only solve problems but also add meaning to people’s lives. My journey so far has been guided by curiosity — whether it’s understanding how people think and grow, exploring the power of data, or experimenting with new technologies.</p>

        <p>At this stage, I’m embracing challenges that require creativity, logic, and purpose. I love being around people who inspire me to look at the world differently, and I enjoy working on projects that make me question, reflect, and improve.</p>
<br>
        <h3>Some of my areas of interest include:</h3>
        <ul style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-size: 1.10rem; line-height: 1.6;">
            <li><span class="purple">Data Science & Machine Learning–</span> exploring predictive models and real-world applications.</li>
            <li><span class="purple">Research & Innovation–</span> diving deep into concepts to uncover meaningful insights.</li>
            <li><span class="purple">Human-Computer Connection–</span> understanding how technology influences behavior and decision-making.</li>
        </ul>
<br>
        <p>I’m still at the beginning of my journey, but with every project, I’m growing — not just as a student, but as a thinker and creator. My goal is to blend technology with purpose, and contribute to something bigger than myself.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>✨ Always learning. Always questioning. Always evolving.</strong></p>
